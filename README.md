# Experimental Portfolio

This is a portfolio page made using Adobe After Effects.

## To Start

This app is deployed on GitHub Pages via this link: https://thesamnee.github.io/new-portfolio/

## Technologies Used 

* Adobe After Effects
    - I leveraged my background in motion graphics to create an animation to play in the background of the website.
    - The animation plays on scroll, in an attempt to mimick the style of the Apple Airpods product page, and give the illusion of scrolling down.
    
* Javascript 
    - The scroll handler was created in Javascript.
